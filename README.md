# K'ichee' morphology #

A computational morphology for K'ichee', written in the Foma language 
for finite-state transducers.  Targets the Nahuala/Ixtahuacan dialect
of K'ichee', following as closely as possible Florentino Ajpacaj√°'s 
orthography (as found in his dictionary and translation of the Misal).  
Currently has good coverage for noun and verb inflection, but rather
poor coverage for anything derivational, for anything to do with
adjectives, and for particles and function words.
