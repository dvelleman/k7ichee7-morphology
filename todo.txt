When we allow for random CVC roots, we are doing the priority union at 
the wrong point.  Etymologies involving real CVC transitive roots have
priority over ones with fake CVC transitive roots --- but, for instance,
etymologies involving real *noun* roots do *not* have priority over
ones with fake CVC transitive roots.  (E.g. "nutz'u'uum" can either be
"my hide" or a 1sg perfect of the fake transitive root TZ'U7.  Only
the former etymology should be generated.)

/i7a/ and /i7o/ sequences should contract to /ya7/ and /yo7/, not /a7/
and /o7/.  (E.g. "jya'xeel", "tyo'neem")

Nouns formed with the "aj" gentilic prefix have to be listed individually
in the lexicon, and are treated as morphologically simple.  This is 
probably wrong.

We badly overgenerate plural adjectives from adjective roots.
